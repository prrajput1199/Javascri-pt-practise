<!-- doctype represents HTML 5 -->
<!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. -->

<!-- Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements:<form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. -->

<!-- Here are the block-level elements in HTML:A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video> -->

<!-- Here are the inline elements in HTML:An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
